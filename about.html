    <p>Hey, I'm Rishit, an incoming junior at Rouse High School. As a student, I am currentlly focused on academic growth and learning valuable skills.
    </p>
        <br>
        <p> I am proficient in several programming languages and technologies, including Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java. This skill set allows me to build many different types of applications and tools. I have put these skills to use as a software engineer intern at Radical AI, a programming intern at Stem-E, and a softeware engineering fellow at HeadStarter AI.</p>
       <br>
        <p>Furthermore, I am an active member of DECA, where I have competed at the district level, gaining valuable experience in business and leadership. In Model United Nations, I represent a country and have developed significant diplomatic skills through this experience. Additionally, my participation in speech and debate has further honed my public speaking abilities, as I have attended two tournaments as a junior varsity public forum debater in the greater Austin area.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Aside from academics and learning, I have always been interested in cricket and I am a car enthusiast.
